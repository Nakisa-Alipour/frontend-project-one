Title: Movie Recommender
An application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. Users could search for their favourite movies by their name and receive some info about the movie, such as genres, actors, and etc. Also user can watch the trailer by clicking on second button. Each search movie creates a button in the “Most Recent Searches” area which can retrieve the search information if the user click on it. The application would use server-side APIs like Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to gather data on info and Youtube API to display the trailer.
